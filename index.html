    <p>
      Hi! I am Gabe, 20 years old and I am a freelancer and a web developer
      student currently enrolled in the University of the Cordilleras in Baguio
      City, Philippines. I have a Facebook page named Mustard Designs as I make
      logos for people's businesses and also help them decide on their brand
      design. I am a very patient person, loyal, willing to learn, and always
      willing to move forward with determination.
